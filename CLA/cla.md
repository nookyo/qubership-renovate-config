# Individual Contributor Licensing Agreement

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, NetCracker Technology Corporation (“Netcracker”) must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Netcracker and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to Netcracker. Except for the license granted herein to Netcracker and recipients of software distributed by Netcracker, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

This Contributor Licensing Agreement (“CLA”) applies to any Contribution that you make to any product or project managed by Netcracker, and sets out the intellectual property rights you grant to us in the Contributed Materials.

## 1. Definitions.

The term “Contribution” or “Contributed Materials” means any original work of authorship, including modifications or additions to an existing work, source code, object code, patch, tool, sample, graphic, specification, manual, documentation, comment, or any other material posted or submitted by You to Netcracker for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Netcracker (the ‘Work”). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Netcracker, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Netcracker for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

If you agree to be bound by these terms, fill in the information requested above and sign the CLA where indicated below. Read this agreement carefully before signing. These terms and conditions constitute a binding legal agreement.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Netcracker and to recipients of the software distributed by Netcracker a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, unrestricted, irrevocable copyright license to exercise all rights under those copyrights. This includes, at our option, the rights to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense the same rights through multiple levels of sublicensing, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

You agree that you will not assert any moral rights in your contribution against us, our licensees or transferees;

You agree that we may register a copyright in your contribution and exercise all ownership rights associated with it.

## 3. Grant of Patent License.

With respect to any patents you own, or that you can license without payment to any third party, You hereby grant to Netcracker and to recipients of software distributed by Netcracker a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. You covenant, represent, warrant and agree that:

You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Netcracker, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Netcracker.

Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Netcracker separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

Each contribution shall be in compliance with U.S. export control laws and other applicable export and import laws.

You agree to notify Netcracker of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

## 5. Support of Contributions.

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You hereby accept and agree to the terms and condition of this CLA
